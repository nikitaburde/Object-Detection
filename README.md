# 🚀 Object Detection Project

Welcome to the **Object Detection Project**! This project demonstrates how to implement object detection using deep learning techniques. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, sample images, and output visualizations to help you understand and experiment with object detection models. 🖼️🔍

---

## 📂 Project Contents

- 📜 `main.ipynb` - The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for object detection.
- 🖼️ `DLguys.jpeg`, `jeff_hinton.png`, etc. - Sample images for detection.
- 📊 `output1.png`, `output2.png`, etc. - Visualization of detected objects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikitaburde/Object-Detection.git
```

2️⃣ **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd Object-Detection
```

3️⃣ **Open the Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## 📦 Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed before running the project:

✅ Jupyter Notebook  
✅ TensorFlow or PyTorch  
✅ OpenCV  
✅ NumPy  
✅ Matplotlib  

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

📝 *Note:* Replace `tensorflow` with `torch` if the implementation uses PyTorch.
